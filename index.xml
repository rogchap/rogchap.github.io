      <description>grpc-gatway is a protoc plugin that reads protobuf service definitions and generates a reverse-proxy server which translates a RESTful HTTP API into gRPC.
Each field in a proto message would normally match to a JSON field:
message Request { id int32 = 1; first_name string = 2; last_name string = 3;}{ &amp;#34;id&amp;#34;: 123456, &amp;#34;first_name&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;Roger&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;last_name&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;Chapman&amp;#34; } However, for a webhook (or other arbitrary data) being POSTed you may just want to pass the raw JSON body to your gRPC handler.</description>

      <description>One of delights of using the Go programming language is how quickly Engineers can learn and start using the language; but at the same time, Engineers also &amp;ldquo;Copy/Paste&amp;rdquo; without some of the understanding.
Go&amp;rsquo;s empty interface interface{} is one such mystery when learning the language; Engineers are happy to use interface{} to represent any type, but get confused about the interface keyword and why it&amp;rsquo;s used.
let i:any = 1; // Typescript std::any i = 1; // C++17 Object i = 1; // Java var i interface{} = 1 // Go   &amp;ldquo;interface{} says nothing&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Rob Pike  Interface type Lets start with a regular interface:</description>

      <description>I recently completed the first part of the awesome &amp;ldquo;From Nand to Tetris&amp;rdquo; course. For project 6 you build an Assembler for the HACK Computer using a high level language of your choice; naturally I did my project using Go (Golang).
The HACK Assembly language is very simple, and an Assembler could be written using string manipulation in less than 50 lines of code. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to build a lexer/scanner and parser in Go and thought this would be a great little project to do so.</description>

      <title>In Process gRPC-Web Proxy</title>

      <description>From the official gRPC-Web docs:
 &amp;ldquo;gRPC-Web clients connect to gRPC services via a special gateway proxy: the current version of the library uses Envoy by default, in which gRPC-Web support is built-in.&amp;rdquo;
 For production we can just enable the envoy.grpc_web filter and we are good to go.
But for development I wanted to create a gRPC server that engineers could install via a single binary and not have to run anything extra (like envoy running in docker).</description>

      <description>One of the huge benefits of using gRPC is the ability to autogenerate our client and server stubs from the protocol buffer definitions.
In the same way, we can we generate our own code by building a plugin for the protocol buffer compiler (protoc).
The plugin we&amp;rsquo;re creating is going to auto-generate gRPC response messages so that we can build a mock gRPC server in Go (Golang).
Goal Given the following proto file:</description>
